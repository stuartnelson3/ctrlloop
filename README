ctrlloop (control-loop)
=======================

I found myself copying and pasting this small loop snippet in many places,
seemed like it should be turned into a micro package.

USAGE:

Read the source code, it's tiny.

Pass in a context, an interval on which to execute your run function, and a
cleanup function to execute if the the process receives SIGTERM or SIGINT.

If the context is canceled, the control loop aborts.
If run() returns a non-nil error, the control loop aborts.
If the process receives SIGTERM/SIGINT, the control loop aborts.
